Question 1:
All pixels are contained in the file 'image_pixels.txt'.
I was unsure what you wanted when you said 'print the image file'.
So I iterated through each pixel and printed it's pixel value in a file called image_pixels.txt
Then I wrote the image file to a new file called "new_image_file.png"

Question 2:
My plain text is "keith kenny C13443362"
When it is encrypted then decrpyted it shows:
"keith kenny C13443362"
