The pseudo random number generator I implemented is blum blum shub.
This creates a pseudo random of binary digits, 0 or 1.

I chose to crate 200 values in this pseudo random list of keys:

Here is that generated string of values:
01011000110000010000100110110111101010101101101000100110110001011000110000010000100110110111101010101101101000100110110001011000110000010000100110110111101010101101101000100110110001011000110000010000

The test I did is monobit, which checks how evenly distributed the 0's and 1's are:
A desired value is between 1 and 0.
the value this string of digits returns is
0.157
